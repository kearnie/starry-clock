60-212: interactivity &amp; computation deliverable02

Personal preference and style instinctively propelled me in a design, illustrative, streamlined, or nature/environmental-oriented approach 
to the assignment; the fact that it was an assignment with a timekeeping topic kept my ideas in check by balancing them with 
functionality and utility. As “abstract” was a key word to the work’s intentions, I geared my ideas towards nature, going through 
processes as a growing tree (trunk growing by the hour, branches by minute, leaves/flowers by second), and eventually the sky. 
The sky idea stuck with me, in that since origin has time reflexively been associated with the aerial plane–in regards to stargazing, 
orbits of planets, rotations of celestial bodies, etcetera. I decided to further this idea as I settled on my approach: 
with little star specks appear every second, bigger and brighter stars every minute, and constellation fragments per hour of 
current time; all of these would also be characterized by continuous rotations and dimming/brightening cycles via some 
calculation of milliseconds. Hence the product of a non-overwhelming, yet abstract starry night interface of my clock, 
appealing both my environmental and design-based tendencies; while it is reasonably possible to tell the time by counting 
constellation segments and stars, the effect is still subtle and the utility requires some effort; but in connection with 
how time and mother nature wait for no one, I want the audience to feel relaxed while viewing the atmospheric vibe of the 
work–and to sink in to a mere vague notion of time, and to admire the characteristics of this nature-based simulation.

Food for future thought: generation of mist/galaxy patterns/smoke throughout, possible integration of calming instrumental music, 
other celestial bodies/comets (may sacrifice utility and functionality however), subtle rotation of constellation figures around 
some origin…

I am incredibly thankful that my clock seems to have generally been well-received; general consensus when it came to improvements 
involved making the constellation fragments connect more orderly to construct shapes of some sort, rather than be as random as 
they are now. I agree with this sentiment and also came across the thought during my process, but because of lack of time, 
did not finalize my product with this in mind. I hope to revisit this asset and to ensure that later-formed lines’ x1,y1,x2,y2 
coordinates be the x1,y1 or x2,y2 of previous lines so that the constellations will have a higher chance of forming polygons, 
and avoid haphazard intersections. I feel this would also alleviate the critiques that the hours are hard to read because of the 
random placements of the fragments; with less intersections, each fragment would ideally be distinctively apparent and the reader 
would be able to easily count the lines.
